# Work under progress

the idea of this API: to control a cheat with an API, and can be interacted with through a website or however someone chooses to use the API. </br>
this API is based on: </br>

* node.js
* express.js
* Redis </br>

# How to run this

1. Run a redis server </br>
    * you can use a WSL system if youre on windows, use <a src="https://redis.io/blog/redis-on-windows-10/">this tutorial</a> to do so. (Windows 10)
1. Go to the server folder in your terminal then run the following command:

```batch
node app.js
```

1. the client isnt done yet.

this is just a quick write up, not the best tutorial.
a proper one will be done later.
