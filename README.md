# Work under progress

the idea of this project: a cheat that's controlled by an API, and can be interacted with through a website or however you choose to use the API. </br>
the API is based on: </br>

* node.js
* express.js
* Redis </br>

And of course C++ for the cheat client, and communication, but it's not fully done yet...

this is an attempt of me trying to mix up something I already know and love *game hacking* with learning something new *back&front-end dev*
